# Flutter Challenge

## Brief

This Flutter app needs to display the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API.
This code challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache and technical skills along the way.

## Tasks

- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json
- A clean modern look
- A good user experience
- Allow the top 100 to be searchable
- Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced search, integration with other API, a "
  Favorite" functionality)
  - Describe the feature in separate markdown file
